## Hello, world!

Let's test our installation!

Open up a terminal and create a new Passerine project in a directory called `hello_world` by running:
```
$ aspen new hello_world
```

> Alternatively, you can run `aspen new` to create a new project in the current directory.

Enter the directory, and open `main.pn` using your favorite IDE or text editor.

You should see:

```
println "Hello, Passerine!"
```

You can execute this file in the terminal by running:

```
$ aspen run
```

You should see the output:
```
Hello, Passerine
```

Now, let's move on to the core language!
