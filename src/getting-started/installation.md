## Installation
Passerine is still very much so a work in progress. We've done a lot, but there's still a so much more to do!

For you pioneers out there, The best way to get a feel for Passerine is to install [Aspen](https://github.com/vrtbl/aspen)¹, Passerine's package manager and CLI.

If you use a *nix-style² system, run³:

```bash
sh <(curl -sSf https://www.passerine.io/install.sh)
```

> 1. If you're having trouble getting started, reach out on the community [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yMhUyhw).
> 2. Tested on Arch (btw) and macOS.
> 3. Now tested on Windows™!
> 4. (Also, *experimentally* supports Wasm.)
> 5. In the future, we plan to distribute prebuilt binaries, but for now, both Git and Cargo are required.
