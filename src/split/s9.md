### Fibers
How does passerine handle errors? What about concurrency?

What do prime sieves, exceptions, and for-loops have in common? If you guessed concurrency, you won a bajillion points! Structured concurrency is a difficult problem to tackle, given how pervasive it is in the field language design.

It's important to point out that concurrency is *not* the same thing as parallelism. Concurrent systems may be parallel, but that's not always the case. Passerine subscribes to the coroutine model of structured concurrency – more succinctly, Passerine uses *fibers* – as exemplified by [Wren](https://wren.io). A fiber is a lightweight process of execution that is cooperatively scheduled with other fibers. Each fiber is like a little system unto itself that can pass messages to other fibers.
