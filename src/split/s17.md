### Concluding Thoughts
Thanks for reading this far. Passerine has been a joy for me to work on, and I hope you find it a joy to use.

A few of the features discussed in this overview haven't been implemented yet. We're not trying to sell you short, it's just that developing a programming language and bootstrapping a community around it at the same time is not exactly *easy*. If you'd like something added to Passerine, [open an issue or pull request](#Contributing), or check out the [roadmap](#roadmap).
