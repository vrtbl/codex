### Who started this?
This is first project of The Veritable Computation Initiative. Our goal is to improve the tools developers use to write software. We're planning release a site with more information about Veritable soon.

Passerine is currently being developed by [Isaac Clayton](https://github.com/slightknack), a high-school student with too much free time on his hands. A few people have offered feedback and suggestions from time to time. Huge thanks to

> † Shaw is writing an [alternative implementation of Passerine](https://github.com/ShawSumma/purr/tree/main/ext/passerine), and it's *super* fast. It's part of a wider effort of his to develop [an efficient language-agnostic VM](https://github.com/ShawSumma/purr).

> ‡ Keith is currently [sponsoring](https://www.patreon.com/slightknack) the development of Passerine — I'm deeply grateful for his support!
