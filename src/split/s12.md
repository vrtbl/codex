### Macros
Passerine has a rich hygienic* syntactic macro system that extends the language itself.

*Syntactic macros*, quite simply, are bits of code that *hygienically* produce more code when invoked at compile time. Macros use a small, simple-yet-powerful set of rules to transform code.

> \* Having read Doug Hoyte's exellent [Let Over Lambda](https://letoverlambda.com/), I understand the raw power of a rich *unhygenic* macro system. However, such systems are hard to comprehend, and harder to master. Passerine aims to be as simple and powerful as possible without losing *transparency*: hygienic macro systems are much more transparent then their opaque unhygenic counterparts.
