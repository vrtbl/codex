#### Concurrency
Fibers are for more than just isolating the context of errors. As mentioned earlier:

> A fiber is a lightweight process of execution that is cooperatively scheduled with other fibers. Each fiber is like a little system unto itself that can pass messages to other fibers.

Passerine leverages fibers to handle errors, but fibers are full *coroutines*. To create a fiber, use the fiber keyword:

```elm
counter = fiber {
    i = 0
    loop { yield i; i = i + 1 }
}

print counter () -> prints 0
print counter () -> prints 1
print counter () -> ...
```

The `yield` keyword suspends the current fiber and returns a value to the calling fiber. `yield` can also be used to pass data *into* a fiber.

```elm
passing_yield = fiber {
    print "hello"
    result = yield "banana"
    print result
    "yes"
}

passing_yield "first"  -- prints "hello" then evaluates to "banana"
passing_yield "second" -- prints "second" then evaluates to "yes"
passing_yield "uh oh"  -- raises an error, fiber is done
```

To build more complex systems, you can build fibers with functions:

```elm
-- a function that returns a fiber
flopper = this that -> fiber {
    loop {
        yield this
        yield that
    }
}

apple_banana = flopper "Apple" "Banana"

apple_banana () -- evaluates to "Apple"
apple_banana () -- evaluates to "Banana"
apple_banana () -- evaluates to "Apple"
apple_banana () -- ... you get the point
```


Of course, the possibilities are endless. There's one last thing I'd like to discuss before we start talking about macros. Fibers, while usually being ran in the context of another, all act as peers to each-other. If you have a reference to a fiber, it's possible to transfer to it forgetting the context in which it was called. To switch to a fiber, use `switch`.

```elm
banana_and_end = fiber {
    print "banana ending!"
}

print "the beginning..."
switch banana_and_end
print "the end."
```

`"the end."` is never displayed.

> 'Tis not the end, 'tis but the beginning... 'tis hackin' time!
