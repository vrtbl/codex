#### Hygiene
Extensions are defined with the `syntax` keyword, followed by some *argument patterns*, followed by the code that the captured arguments will be spliced into. Here's a simple example: we're using a macro to define `swap` operator:

```elm
syntax a 'swap b {
    tmp = a
    a = b
    b = tmp
}

x = 7
y = 3
x swap y
```

Note that the above code is completely hygienic. the expanded macro looks something like this:

```elm
_tmp = x
x = y
x = _tmp
```

Because `tmp` was not passed as a macro pattern parameter, all uses of `tmp` in the macro body are unique unrepresentable variables that do not collide with any other variables currently bound in scope. Essentially:

```elm
tmp = 1
x = 2
y = 3
x swap y
```

Will not affect the value of `tmp`; `tmp` will still be `1`.
