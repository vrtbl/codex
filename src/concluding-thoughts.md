## Concluding Thoughts
Thanks for reading this far. Passerine has been a joy for me to work on, and I hope you find it a joy to use.

A few of the features discussed in this overview haven't been implemented yet. We're not trying to sell you short, it's just that developing a programming language and bootstrapping a community around it at the same time is not exactly *easy*.

If you'd like something added to Passerine, open an issue or pull request, or check out the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine/projects/1) to get a feel for what's currently under development.
